# Red Team Research 🛡️

A collection of security research focused on understanding how systems can be tested and strengthened.

## About This Repository

This is where I explore red team methodologies - the practice of testing security defenses by thinking like someone who might try to bypass them. The goal is to improve security by understanding potential weaknesses.

## What is Red Teaming?

Red teaming is about:
- Testing security controls in realistic scenarios
- Identifying areas where defenses can be improved
- Understanding how different security systems work together
- Developing better detection and response capabilities

## Research Focus

I explore various aspects of security testing including:
- Different techniques security professionals use to test systems
- How to properly conduct security assessments
- Ways to measure and improve security posture

## Why This Research Matters

By understanding how security tests work, we can:
- Build more resilient systems
- Develop better detection methods
- Train more effective security teams
- Create comprehensive security strategies

## Getting Started

If you're interested in security testing:
1. Review the research materials in each folder
2. Understand the concepts before trying any techniques
3. Always follow responsible disclosure practices

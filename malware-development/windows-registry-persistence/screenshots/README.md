# Screenshots Documentation

## Visual Demonstration

These screenshots show the complete process of the registry persistence technique in action.

### 1. Before Execution
**File:** `01-before-execution.png`

**What it shows:**
- Registry Editor before running the program
- No `MySafeDemo` key exists under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\`
- Clean state demonstrating nothing is modified yet

### 2. Program Output  
**File:** `02-program-output.png`

**What it shows:**
- The program running in command prompt
- Successful registry write operation
- Successful registry read operation  
- Safe display of the stored data as hexadecimal
- The "calc.exe" string being retrieved and shown
- Program waiting for user input at the end

### 3. After Execution
**File:** `03-after-execution.png`

**What it shows:**
- Registry Editor after program execution
- New `MySafeDemo` key created under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\`
- The "nizar" value containing binary data
- REG_BINARY data type confirmation
- Proof that data was successfully stored in registry

## The Complete Story

These images demonstrate the full lifecycle:
1. **Clean Start** - No registry modifications exist
2. **Program Execution** - Data is written, read, and displayed safely  
3. **Verification** - Registry shows the persistent data storage

## Technical Details Visible

- **Registry Path**: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MySafeDemo`
- **Value Name**: "nizar"
- **Data Type**: REG_BINARY
- **Stored Data**: "calc.exe" as hexadecimal bytes
- **Safety**: No code execution, only data storage and retrieval

## Purpose

These screenshots provide visual proof that:
- The technique works as intended
- Data persists in registry after program execution  
- The demonstration is safe and educational
- The concept can be easily understood and verified

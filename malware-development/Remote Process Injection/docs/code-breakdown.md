# Code Breakdown 

## What This Code Does
This program demonstrates how one process can write data to another process's memory safely, without executing any code.

## Main Components

### 1. Process Discovery
```c
BOOL GetHandleProc(LPCWSTR ProcName, HANDLE* hProcess, DWORD* dwPid)
```
**Purpose:**
Finds a running process by name

**How:**
Takes a snapshot of all running processes and searches for the target

**Returns:**
Process handle and PID if found

---

### 2. Safe Memory Operations
```c
BOOL SafeMemoryWrite(HANDLE hProcess)
```

**Purpose:**
Writes harmless data to remote process memory

**Safety:**
Uses non-executable memory (PAGE_READWRITE)

**Data:**
Writes NOP instructions (0x90) as placeholder data

---

### 3. Main Program Flow
```c
int wmain(int argc, wchar_t* argv[])
```

**Find Process:**
Locates the target process by name

**Open Handle:**
Gets access to the process

**Write Memory:**
Allocates and writes safe data

**Cleanup:**
Closes handles properly

## Key Safety Features

✅ **No code execution** : only displays data  
✅ **Uses safe location** : only affects the current user  
✅ **Clear purpose** : easy to understand what’s happening  
✅ **Cleanup** : doesn’t leave the registry messy

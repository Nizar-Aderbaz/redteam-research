# Functions Explanation

## GetHandleProc()
**Purpose**: Finds and opens a process by name

**Key Operations:**
- `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot()` - Takes snapshot of running processes
- `Process32FirstW()/Process32NextW()` - Enumerates processes
- `OpenProcess()` - Opens handle to target process

**Parameters:**
- `ProcName`: Process executable name to find
- `hProcess`: Returns handle to the process
- `dwPid`: Returns Process ID

## SafeMemoryWrite()
**Purpose**: Safely writes data to remote process memory

**Key Operations:**
- `VirtualAllocEx()` - Allocates memory in remote process
- `WriteProcessMemory()` - Writes data to allocated memory
- Uses `PAGE_READWRITE` - Memory cannot be executed

**Safety Measures:**
- Non-executable memory permissions
- Writes only placeholder data (NOPs)
- Proper cleanup on failure

## Windows API Used
- Process Enumeration: CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, Process32FirstW, Process32NextW
- Process Access: OpenProcess
- Memory Operations: VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, VirtualFreeEx

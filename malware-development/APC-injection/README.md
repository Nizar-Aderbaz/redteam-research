# APC Injection Technique 

This demonstration shows how Windows Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC) can be used to execute code in another thread's context.

## Technique Overview

APC Injection is used by:
- Debuggers for injecting breakpoints
- I/O completion mechanisms
- Malware for stealthy code execution
- Security tools for monitoring

## What This Demonstrates

This is an **educational demo** that shows:
- How Windows threads can enter "alertable" states
- How to schedule code to run in another thread using `QueueUserAPC`
- A completely safe way to understand APC mechanics

## Note

- This is 100% safe to run on any Windows system. It only shows a message box within its own process.


## Quick Start

```bash
# Compile
gcc src/apc-injection.c -o samples/apc-injection.exe

# Run
samples/apc-injection.exe
